# Project Overview

Welcome to my project! I will predicting stock prices using pandas and scikit-learn. 

My goal is clear: profitable trades with minimized risk. I will built a machine learning model predicting next-day stock prices from today's data. I optimize for precision, buying when it predicts price increase and refraining when it anticipates declines.

Here's the roadmap:

1. **Data Download**: I source GSPC stock prices from Yahoo Finance, setting up my analysis.

2. **Data Exploration**: I dive deep into data, uncovering insights.

3. **Data Setup**: Armed with historical prices, I prep data to predict future prices, setting the stage for my model.

4. **Machine Learning Testing**: I test my model, refining its accuracy.

5. **Model Enhancement**: Model fine-tuning, readying it for real-world trading scenarios.
